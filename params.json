  "body": "### RESEARCH AND DATA ANALYSIS\r\n   By definition, analysis of data refers to the process of inspecting, cleaning, transforming, and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information, suggesting conclusions, and supporting decision-making. As it applies to web design and development; then, our first step is actually the most important and involves a solid understanding of the company's main objective. Well-defined requirements and considerations include:\r\n\r\n   .Careful Research & Main Purpose  \r\n   .Planning  \r\n   .Target Audience  \r\n   .Actual Content  \r\n\r\n### PLANNING\r\n   Planning is a crucial aspect of web development because it is here when many decisions are made that will affect the design, implementation, and later deployment of a web portal. Georotz Web Solutions adheres to standard W3 principles. Therefore; as to deliver productive and profitable web projects, we follow an strategic plan at all phases during web development. We employ latest techniques and technologies for successful web planning\r\n\r\n### WEB DESIGN\r\n   Web design and applications involve the standards for building and rendering web pages which include: HTML, CSS, SVG, device APIs, and other technologies for web applications (“WebApps”).\r\n   If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### WEB DEVELOPMENT [Authors and Contributors]\r\n   Once web design phase is complete and approved, we proceed to next stage, \"Web Development\". Based upon well-defined requirements by the site's owner, our web development's team mission will be to code /or program required web pages that will make such website functional whether be at intranet or global level.\r\n   You can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### TESTING AND DELIVERY [Support or Contact]\r\n   Web application testing, a software testing technique exclusively adopted to test the applications that are hosted on web in which the application interfaces and other functionalities are tested.\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out our [documentation](https://help.github.com/pages) or [contact support](https://github.com/contact) and we’ll help you sort it out.\r\n",
