<p>By definition, analysis of data refers to the process of inspecting, cleaning, transforming, and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information, suggesting conclusions, and supporting decision-making. As it applies to web design and development; then, our first step is actually the most important and involves a solid understanding of the company's main objective. Well-defined requirements and considerations include:</p>

<p>.Careful Research &amp; Main Purpose<br>
   .Planning<br>
   .Target Audience<br>
   .Actual Content  </p>

<a id="planning" class="anchor" href="#planning" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>PLANNING</h3>

<p>Planning is a crucial aspect of web development because it is here when many decisions are made that will affect the design, implementation, and later deployment of a web portal. Georotz Web Solutions adheres to standard W3 principles. Therefore; as to deliver productive and profitable web projects, we follow an strategic plan at all phases during web development. We employ latest techniques and technologies for successful web planning</p>

<h3>
<a id="web-design" class="anchor" href="#web-design" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>WEB DESIGN</h3>

<p>Web design and applications involve the standards for building and rendering web pages which include: HTML, CSS, SVG, device APIs, and other technologies for web applications (“WebApps”).
   If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<p>Once web design phase is complete and approved, we proceed to next stage, "Web Development". Based upon well-defined requirements by the site's owner, our web development's team mission will be to code /or program required web pages that will make such website functional whether be at intranet or global level.
   You can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
